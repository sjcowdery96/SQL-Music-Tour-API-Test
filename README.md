###Overview
This assignment is a solution copy populated with comments as an agreed substitute to a final submission. 

The comments with three "///" marks are where I have added clarification and documentation to the assignment.

All other comments have been retained from the original solution.

I certify I did not use an LLM to quickly sort this code but only used google searches to clarify areas and concepts in small batches.

Signed,
Sam Cowdery
